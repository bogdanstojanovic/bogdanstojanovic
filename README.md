### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Bogdan. I am Software developer that like to go outside comfortability zone and fix things.  

My dopamine level is strongly impacted by fixing things in software development and make people I work with happy.  
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js (Sanity CMS)  
 
ðŸ‘¯ I do not care so much about the industry as long as it makes an impact to society and do not harm others.
