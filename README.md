### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Bogdan. I am Software developer with specialization in diagnosis and resolving your CMS and web application pains.  

My dopamine level is strongly impacted by fixing your headaches.  
My approach to tech and business peeps are simple. No flashy tricks or superhero skills. I do not believe in superheroes. 
I listen, I think in temrs of your benefit and apply my knowledge through experience in technology. All that in ways that makes things easier for you, not harder.
