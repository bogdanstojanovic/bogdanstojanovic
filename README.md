### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Bogdan. I am a Software developer with specialization in diagnosis and resolving CMS and web applications.  

âš¡Your web apps headaches. A thing of the past. 
ðŸ¤”How can I say that with confidence?

My approach to tech and business proffesionals is simple. No flashy tricks or superhero skills. I do not believe in superheroes. 
I listen, I think in terms of your benefit, and apply my knowledge through experience in technology. 

ðŸ’¬ Azure, Asp.net core, C#, Next.js, Astro, Typescript, Optimizely, Umbraco, Sanity... 

#### All implemented in ways that make things easier for you, not harder.
